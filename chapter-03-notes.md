# Chapter 3: Ethereum Clients and Network Architecture

## Key Concepts Mastered

### What is an Ethereum Client?
- Software that connects computers to the Ethereum network
- Acts as "frontend" to the blockchain backend
- Handles protocol rules, networking, transaction processing

### Three Types of Clients Used in Chapter 2
1. **Remote Client (MetaMask)**: Managed keys, signed transactions
2. **Development Client (Remix)**: Compiled contracts, created deployment transactions  
3. **Full Node Client (Infura)**: Processed transactions, stored blockchain data

### Client Diversity Importance
- Multiple implementations in different languages (Geth/Go, Nethermind/C#, Besu/Java)
- Prevents single points of failure
- 2016 DoS attacks proved this - Parity kept running when Geth had issues
- Ethereum Yellow Paper defines rules, multiple clients implement them

### Network Types
- **Mainnet**: Real ETH, production applications
- **Sepolia Testnet**: Free ETH, perfect for learning (what I used)
- **Private Networks**: Local development, complete control

### Post-Merge Architecture (2022 Change)
- **Execution Client**: Handles transactions and smart contracts (Geth, Nethermind)
- **Consensus Client**: Handles Proof of Stake validation (Prysm, Lighthouse)
- Need BOTH clients to run a full node now

### JSON-RPC Interface
- How applications communicate with Ethereum
- Request/response format in JSON
- MetaMask used this to send my transactions to Infura
- Tried making direct JSON-RPC calls (browser blocked for security)

## Hardware Requirements (2025)
- **Storage**: 800GB+ (massive growth from book's 100GB)
- **RAM**: 16GB+ 
- **Why increased**: Blockchain growth, Proof of Stake complexity

## Modern Infrastructure Services
- **Infura**: What MetaMask uses (node-as-a-service)
- **Alchemy**: Developer-focused infrastructure
- **QuickNode**: High-performance access
- Makes development accessible without running own nodes

## Key Insights
- Blockchain engineering = Backend engineering for Web3
- Remote clients perfect for learning (no need for full nodes yet)
- Infrastructure services democratize blockchain development
- Client diversity is crucial for network security
